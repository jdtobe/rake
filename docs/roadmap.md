# Rake roadmap

## Goal

Rake is a fast, native, always-available terminal that drops down from the top of the screen on a global hotkey, in the spirit of the console in Quake. macOS first, cross-platform if practical.

## Expected feature set

**Core**
- Menubar/tray icon with About and Quit
- Global hotkey toggles the terminal
- Borderless, always-on-top window that slides in and out
- A real shell session in a PTY, with a proper terminal emulator (colors, cursor, resize, scrollback)

**Later**
- Configuration file (hotkey, height, shell, position, opacity)
- **Settings menu** in the menubar icon's context menu, so settings such as the hotkey, window width and height, and hide-on-focus-lost can be changed in the app instead of by editing the config file. The config file stays the source of truth; the Settings UI reads and writes it.
- Show over full-screen apps and on every Space (done for the display under the mouse)
- Appear on the display that holds the focused window, as an alternative to the mouse
- Tab drag reordering (wanted follow-up); split panes remain uncommitted
- Signed and notarised releases (the DMG ships ad-hoc signed until then)
- Linux and Windows support

**Non-goals for now**
- Replacing a full terminal application
- Plugins or scripting

## Milestones

Each milestone is a small, shippable slice built test-first (see [principles](principles.md)).

1. **Menubar icon (done):** `cargo run` shows an icon with About and Quit.
2. **Hotkey (done):** a global hotkey fires an event in the existing event loop and toggles the visibility state. The default is `Ctrl+\``, and it is user-configurable via the TOML config file ([ADR 5](adr/0005-toml-config-read-at-startup.md)).
3. **Window (done):** a borderless, always-on-top window appears at the top of the screen, centered, and disappears on the hotkey. It began with a dark placeholder and now hosts the terminal. Size is configurable (`width_percent`, `height_percent`), as is hiding on focus loss (`hide_on_focus_lost`).
4. **Animation (done, small start-up hitch):** the window slides in from above the top edge and back out instead of popping. Toggling mid-slide reverses smoothly. Configurable with `animation_ms` ([ADR 6](adr/0006-animation-on-the-event-loop.md)).
5. **Terminal (done):** one persistent default login shell in a PTY, rendered by bundled xterm.js in a WKWebView, with WebGL and a DOM fallback. Hiding preserves the process and scrollback; shell exit leaves the completed terminal visible. Typing, colours, `vim` and `top`, `Ctrl+C`, clipboard, 100,000 lines of output, hide/show and exit were checked by hand on macOS. The panel stays at its configured size; drag-resizing is not implemented.
6. **Tabs (implemented; native hand checks pending):** independent shell sessions, configurable bottom/top tabs, cwd inheritance, manual/automatic names, close/quit confirmation, optional fresh-shell layout restoration and independent System/Light/Dark controls. Tabs take priority over the general Settings UI. Drag reordering is wanted follow-up work.
7. **Config UI:** user-editable settings with sensible defaults already live in TOML; the in-app Settings menu follows tabs.
8. **Polish (partly done):** the panel opens on the display under the mouse, is present on every Space, and joins full-screen apps. Remaining: focus behavior and the start-of-slide hitch.
9. **Release (partly done):** `scripts/package.sh` builds `Rake.app` and a DMG, and the release workflow publishes it. Signing and notarisation wait for an Apple Developer account.
10. **Cross-platform:** Linux and Windows.

Milestones 1 to 5 formed the first usable single-session terminal. Tabs are the current priority, followed by their native acceptance checks, then the broader Settings UI and polish. Profiles remain separate future work.
